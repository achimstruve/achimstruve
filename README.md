## About Me

I build production AI systems and design economic mechanisms for decentralized networks at [Outlier Ventures](https://outlierventures.io). My work focuses on applied AI: multi-agent systems, LLM-powered automation, reinforcement learning, and the infrastructure needed for autonomous agents to participate in economic systems.

I hold a **Dr.-Ing. (Summa Cum Laude)** from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, where I developed expertise in complex systems simulation, optimization, and sensitivity analysis. Today, I apply these quantitative methods to build AI systems that transform business operations and to model economic mechanisms for Web3 protocols.

Beyond the technical, I lead teams, shape strategy, and represent the company as a thought leader on AI and decentralized systems. I've presented at **EthCC** and the **Oxford Blockchain Society**, authored the "Post Web" thesis on agentic AI convergence with distributed ledger technology, and consistently achieve ~9/10 client satisfaction across 30+ protocol advisory engagements.

## What I Do

### AI Systems & Agents
Building production AI systems that automate complex workflows: investment due diligence automation (80% time reduction, ~$5.63/report), real-time portfolio monitoring agents, and multi-agent architectures. Deep experience with LLM orchestration, tool use, and agent design patterns.

### Reinforcement Learning
Developing RL agents for financial optimization problems. Built PPO-based systems for dynamic liquidity provision with curriculum learning, shaped reward functions, and 25-dimensional state spaces.

### Economic Systems Design
Modeling incentive mechanisms and economic dynamics for decentralized networks. Created the **Quantitative Token Model (QTM)**, an open-source simulation framework for designing sustainable digital economies, used in 50+ engagements.

### Research & Thought Leadership
Publishing research on AI verification, agentic systems, and economic mechanism design. Author of the "Post Web" thesis on AI agents + distributed ledger convergence. Speaker at EthCC and Oxford Blockchain Society.

### Strategic Leadership
Building and leading teams, authoring company-wide AI strategy (proposal to 3 production systems in 12 months), and advising C-level executives at protocols including BASE, Fetch.ai, and Lisk.
