I build production AI systems and design economic mechanisms for decentralized networks at [Outlier Ventures](https://outlierventures.io). My focus: multi-agent systems, LLM automation, reinforcement learning, and infrastructure for autonomous agents in economic systems.

**Dr.-Ing. (Summa Cum Laude)** from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. Speaker at **EthCC** and **Oxford Blockchain Society**. Author of the "Post Web" thesis on agentic AI + DLT convergence.

## What I Build

**AI Systems & Agents** — Production workflows for investment DD (80% time reduction), portfolio monitoring, multi-agent architectures

**Reinforcement Learning** — PPO agents for financial optimization, curriculum learning, complex state spaces

**Economic Simulation** — Open-source frameworks for modeling incentive mechanisms and network dynamics
